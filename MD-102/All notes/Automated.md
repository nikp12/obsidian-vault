Methods include the [[Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit]], [[Microsoft Configuration Manager]], and [[Microsoft Development Toolkit]].
These methods are image-based, typed include thick, thin, and hybrid
They wipe the contents of the drive they are being installed on
They require infrastructure built around deployment, including drives to store the images and a distribution depot.

Clients can install via a PXE boot across the network
Multicasting, which allows the server to distribute to multiple machines with one “message” on the network, improves efficiency
