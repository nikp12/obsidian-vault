Upgrading retains user profiles, apps, and settings when possible.
It saves a lot of time vs migrating.
Upgrading can be rolled back, in 10 or 30 days depending on the target OS.
The process can be managed and scripted.

There are some inconsistencies caused by upgrades:
- ACL lists
- Windows feature leftovers
- Registry and file leftovers


Upgrades are not possible to go from 32x to 64x, or for BIOS to UEFI.
They are also not possible if using non-Microsoft encryption.

The process is supported by Windows 7, 7 SP1, 8.1 (not 8.0).
