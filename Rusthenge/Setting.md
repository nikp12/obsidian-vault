The adventure begins in the village of [[Osprey Cove]], on [[Chakikoth Isle]] in western [[New Thassilon]]. The focus for the full adventure is a stretch of the isle’s southern shores, known as the [[Kindred Coast]]. Approximately 20 hours’ trek to the north is [[Old Xin-Edassaril]], a dangerous ruin which once was the capital of [[Runelord Belimarius]]’s nation.
