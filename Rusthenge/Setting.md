The adventure begins in the village of [[Osprey Cove]], on [[Chakikoth Isle]] in western [[New Thassilon]]. The focus for the full adventure is a stretch of the isle’s southern shores, known as the [[Kindred Coast]]. Approximately 20 hours’ trek to the north is [[Old Xin-Edassaril]], a dangerous ruin which once was the capital of [[Runelord Belimarius]]’s nation. The island is a part of the [[Ironbound Archipelago]]. 

In the year 4606 [[AR]], the dawn of the [[Age of Lost Omens]], a series of powerful storms ravaged the world, including the pirate city of [[Riddleport]] in [[Varisia]]. Two siblings in Riddleport, [[Dartanious]] and [[Santwi]], used the chaos to escape servitude under Riddleport’s crime lords. [[Dartanious]], who was military minded, had been waiting for an appropriate diversion to put into play a plan he had devised to escape while [[Santwi]] inspired fellow captives and convinced them to attempt an escape.

With nearly a hundred followers, the brothers made their way north across the [[Shining Sea]] and landed on the coast that would become known as the [[Kindred Coast]]. They founded [[Osprey Cove]], naming it after the birds that populated the shoreline.
