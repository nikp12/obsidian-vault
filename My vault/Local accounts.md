Local accounts are accounts created directly on a Windows 10 or 11 device.

No network access is needed to access these accounts.

The credentials are stored in the [[Security Accounts Manager (SAM)]] section of the [[Registry]].

Local accounts can be customized with gpedit.

There are two accounts which cannot be deleted:

1. Administrator: This account runs with no UAC and its security token is always elevated.
2.
