# Authentication fundamentals

The core of authentication is proving identity. Identity should be a combination of hard to fake, hard to steal, and time limited. Combining these categories makes for higher security. This principal is called [[Multifactor Authentication (MFA)]].

There are two types of identity authentication security: Hardware based and software based.

Hardware based includes [[hardware tokens]] and [[firmware passwords]].
